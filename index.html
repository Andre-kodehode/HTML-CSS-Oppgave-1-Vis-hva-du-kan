          The truth of Ergo is not meant for all. Proceed at your own risk.

          You have stepped into the forbidden archives of The Alchemist Order.
          What you seek is not meant for all, and knowledge comes at a cost. The
          history of Krat is a lie, veiled by illusions of progress and power.
          The truth is buried beneath the cold touch of Ergo, pulsing like a
          dying star.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were the architects of miracles, the sculptors of divine energy. We
          unlocked secrets that the world was not prepared to hold. But with
          every revelation came a shadow, and from that shadow, the Puppets
          rose. The Grand Covenant was never meant to break. Yet, it did.
        </p>
        <p class="scrambled-text">
          Inside these archives, you will find the remnants of our greatest
          discoveries—and our most damning mistakes. Ergo is alive. Ergo
          remembers. Ergo twists those who seek it.
        </p>
        <p class="warning-text">
          Proceed, if you must. But be warned: the deeper you go, the less of
          yourself you may return with.
