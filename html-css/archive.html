          Welcome, Seeker. You stand at the threshold of forgotten knowledge,

        <!-- Chapter 1 -->
        <div class="chapter">
          <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter I: The Genesis of Ergo</h2>
          <p>
            The birth of Ergo. We reached beyond the veil, unlocking the divine
            energy that would shape the world. But with it, came the cost—an
            awakening that would alter the course of human fate.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Chapter 2 -->
        <div class="chapter">
          <h2 class="chapter-title">
            Chapter II: The Grand Covenant and its Fall
          </h2>
          <p>
            An oath forged in blood and ambition. A pact to harness power, to
            control the flow of Ergo. But with each step forward, the Covenant's
            fragile foundations cracked, and the shadow of corruption spread.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Chapter 3 -->
        <div class="chapter">
          <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter III: The Rise of the Puppets</h2>
          <p>
            In our pursuit of creation, we gave life to the Puppets—artificial
            beings, forged with the power of Ergo. Their purpose was to serve,
            but they became something else. Something far darker.

        <!-- Chapter 4 (Fragmented) -->
        <div class="chapter fragment">
          <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter IV: The Silent War</h2>
          <p>
            Betrayal… madness… death. Puppets... now walking nightmares. We…
            could not contain it. The
            <span class="fragment-text">Order</span> turned to ash… nothing left
            but fragments. So many broken. The
            <span class="fragment-text">Covenant…</span> shattered. The whispers
            were... too loud...
          </p>
          <p>(Unreadable fragments scattered)</p>

        <div class="chapter fragment">
          <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter V: The Lost Experiments</h2>
          <p>
            We... pushed. Too far. Test subjects? No, just... things...
            monsters—gods. They did not return. Silence. Forbidden, all... shut
            away. Lost. Never meant to be seen, never meant to be known.
          </p>
          <p>(Pages torn, words incomprehensible)</p>

        <div class="chapter fragment">
          <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter VI: Ergo’s Whisper</h2>
          <p>
            It watches now. Alive. Never dies, never fades... every scream…
            every <span class="fragment-text">truth</span> twisted. It…
            speaks... but no one listens. Does it have a voice? Can it hear?
            Will it… care?
          </p>
          <p>(Fading ink, scratches and smudges—then silence)</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Chapter 7 (Fragmented) -->
        <div class="chapter fragment">
          <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter VII: The Puppets’ Reign</h2>
          <p>
            They... are free. We gave them life, and they... gave it
            back—twisted, crawling. No more... masters. Now the
            <span class="fragment-text">Puppets</span>… watch. We built them… we
            <span class="fragment-text">didn't</span>... break the chains... No,
            they... too late now. The end... END... is just... beginning...

          <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter VIII: The Return of the Seeker</h2>
          <p>
            No, no, no—You shouldn’t be here. Why are you—this place… It’s all
            falling apart, the <span class="fragment-text">Order</span> gone,
            gone with the wind. The Puppets? They—they don’t
            <span class="fragment-text">feel</span> anymore, they don’t listen,
            they take, and take, and—wait, no, I—I’m writing, I’m still writing,
            can’t stop writing. Please, leave. Please—don’t—
          </p>

            scrawled hastily)

          <h2 class="archive-title">Archive lockdown</h2>
          <p>
            "The lockdown of the Archive is not just a physical barrier; it is
            the sealing of knowledge too dangerous to be shared. The information
            contained within these walls is a double-edged sword—its potential
            to reshape the world is undeniable, but its corruption is far too
            great. We have seen the consequences of our experiments with Ergo,
            and the world is not ready to face the truth. For the greater good,
            the information must remain locked away, hidden from those who would
            exploit it, and from those who seek to uncover what should never
            have been discovered." –
