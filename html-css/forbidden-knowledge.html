            The birth of Ergo. We reached beyond the veil, unlocking the divine
            energy that would shape the world. But with it, came the cost—an
            awakening that would alter the course of human fate. It was not mere
            power that we unearthed, but a force intertwined with the very
            essence of existence. In the depths of our laboratories, we believed
            we had harnessed it, bent it to our will. The first creations—the
            Puppets—were to be our triumph, vessels of progress and perfection.
            Yet, we failed to understand what we had truly wrought.

            <h3>II. The Echoes Within</h3>
            <p>
              The Ergo did not simply obey. It pulsed with a rhythm unknown, a
              cadence that no mechanism should possess. At first, it was
              dismissed as mere irregularity, an anomaly of the process. But
              then, the dreams began. The researchers reported whispering
              voices, distant echoes within the crystalline matrices, fragments
              of forgotten lives yearning to be heard.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some dared to listen. Others recoiled in horror. For in their
              slumber, the Puppets spoke—not in the language of men, but in the
              shattered cries of those who once were. To question where these
              memories originated was to spiral into the abyss of forbidden
              knowledge, yet the truth clawed its way through the cracks of our
              understanding.
