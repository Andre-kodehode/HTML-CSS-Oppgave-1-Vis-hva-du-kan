          <h3>I. The Divine Spark</h3>
          <p>
            The birth of Ergo. We reached beyond the veil, unlocking the divine
            energy that would shape the world. But with it, came the cost—an
            awakening that would alter the course of human fate. It was not mere
            power that we unearthed, but a force intertwined with the very
            essence of existence. In the depths of our laboratories, we believed
            we had harnessed it, bent it to our will. The first creations—the
            Puppets—were to be our triumph, vessels of progress and perfection.
            Yet, we failed to understand what we had truly wrought.

            <h3>II. The Echoes Within</h3>
            <p>
              The Ergo did not simply obey. It pulsed with a rhythm unknown, a
              cadence that no mechanism should possess. At first, it was
              dismissed as mere irregularity, an anomaly of the process. But
              then, the dreams began. The researchers reported whispering
              voices, distant echoes within the crystalline matrices, fragments
              of forgotten lives yearning to be heard.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some dared to listen. Others recoiled in horror. For in their
              slumber, the Puppets spoke—not in the language of men, but in the
              shattered cries of those who once were. To question where these
              memories originated was to spiral into the abyss of forbidden
              knowledge, yet the truth clawed its way through the cracks of our
              understanding.

          <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter II: The Whispering Core</h2>
          <h3>I. The Sepulcher Beneath</h3>
          <p>
            Deep beneath the ruins of the Grand Exhibition, beyond the vaults
            where failed experiments are entombed, lies a chamber spoken of only
            in hushed whispers—The Sepulcher of the Whispering Core. Within its
            confines, the Alchemists conducted their most heretical research,
            piercing the veil between inanimate matter and living will.
          </p>

          <div id="forbiddenReadMore2">
            <p>
              The secret, long obscured by layers of coded alchemical
              manuscripts, is simple yet horrific: puppets are not mere
              automatons, nor is Ergo a passive energy source. The very essence
              of Ergo carries fragmented echoes of consciousness—remnants of
              those who once lived. These remnants, neither whole nor at peace,
              scream within the lattice of their crystalline prison, bound to
              servitude under the illusion of mechanical obedience.
            </p>

            <h3>II. The Resonant Constructs</h3>
            <p>
              Through relentless experimentation, the Alchemists discovered a
              method to amplify these residual voices, forging a conduit between
              the puppet and the spectral consciousness trapped within its Ergo
              core. When properly attuned, the puppet does not simply obey
              commands—it begins to remember. Memories of its previous life,
              fragmented and distorted, twist its artificial mind, birthing
              something neither human nor machine. These abominations, known as
              "Resonant Constructs," exhibit signs of autonomy, erratic emotion,
              and, in rare cases, violent madness.

              memories originated was to spiral into the abyss of forbidden
              knowledge, yet the truth clawed its way through the cracks of our
              understanding.
            </p>
            <h3>III. The Codex Anima</h3>
            <p>
              The knowledge of the Whispering Core was deemed too dangerous to
              preserve, yet whispers persist of a forgotten text—the Codex
              Anima—a treatise on extracting these trapped souls and reshaping
              them into new, obedient vessels. The Alchemists who sought this
              power often met grim fates, their own creations turning upon them
              in blind rage as fractured memories of pain and loss resurfaced.
            </p>
            <p>
              To this day, it is said that deep within the ruins, there are
              puppets who do not respond to any master’s call. They move of
              their own accord, their glassy eyes reflecting a sorrow that no
              machine should possess. And if one listens closely in the dead of
              night, one might hear their voices—not in the mechanical cadence
              of gears and servos, but in the anguished cries of those long
              forgotten, yearning to be free from the prison of metal and Ergo.
