Chapter I: The Genesis of Ergo

I. The Divine Spark

The birth of Ergo. We reached beyond the veil, unlocking the divine energy that would shape the world. But with it, came the cost—an awakening that would alter the course of human fate.

It was not mere power that we unearthed, but a force intertwined with the very essence of existence. In the depths of our laboratories, we believed we had harnessed it, bent it to our will. The first creations—the Puppets—were to be our triumph, vessels of progress and perfection. Yet, we failed to understand what we had truly wrought.

II. The Echoes Within

The Ergo did not simply obey. It pulsed with a rhythm unknown, a cadence that no mechanism should possess. At first, it was dismissed as mere irregularity, an anomaly of the process. But then, the dreams began. The researchers reported whispering voices, distant echoes within the crystalline matrices, fragments of forgotten lives yearning to be heard.

Some dared to listen. Others recoiled in horror. For in their slumber, the Puppets spoke—not in the language of men, but in the shattered cries of those who once were. To question where these memories originated was to spiral into the abyss of forbidden knowledge, yet the truth clawed its way through the cracks of our understanding.

Chapter II: The Whispering Core

I. The Sepulcher Beneath

Deep beneath the ruins of the Grand Exhibition, beyond the vaults where failed experiments are entombed, lies a chamber spoken of only in hushed whispers—The Sepulcher of the Whispering Core. Within its confines, the Alchemists conducted their most heretical research, piercing the veil between inanimate matter and living will.

The secret, long obscured by layers of coded alchemical manuscripts, is simple yet horrific: puppets are not mere automatons, nor is Ergo a passive energy source. The very essence of Ergo carries fragmented echoes of consciousness—remnants of those who once lived. These remnants, neither whole nor at peace, scream within the lattice of their crystalline prison, bound to servitude under the illusion of mechanical obedience.

II. The Resonant Constructs

Through relentless experimentation, the Alchemists discovered a method to amplify these residual voices, forging a conduit between the puppet and the spectral consciousness trapped within its Ergo core. When properly attuned, the puppet does not simply obey commands—it begins to remember. Memories of its previous life, fragmented and distorted, twist its artificial mind, birthing something neither human nor machine. These abominations, known as "Resonant Constructs," exhibit signs of autonomy, erratic emotion, and, in rare cases, violent madness.

III. The Codex Anima

The knowledge of the Whispering Core was deemed too dangerous to preserve, yet whispers persist of a forgotten text—the Codex Anima—a treatise on extracting these trapped souls and reshaping them into new, obedient vessels. The Alchemists who sought this power often met grim fates, their own creations turning upon them in blind rage as fractured memories of pain and loss resurfaced.

To this day, it is said that deep within the ruins, there are puppets who do not respond to any master’s call. They move of their own accord, their glassy eyes reflecting a sorrow that no machine should possess. And if one listens closely in the dead of night, one might hear their voices—not in the mechanical cadence of gears and servos, but in the anguished cries of those long forgotten, yearning to be free from the prison of metal and Ergo.
